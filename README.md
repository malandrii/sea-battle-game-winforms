### 3. Your turns
* Press on the enemy field button. You and the enemy go one by one. <br />
* The text of the button displays the turn outcome. `dot` is a hit, `cross` is a miss. <br />

`Status` also helps you monitoring current move action.

* When you hit an enemy ship you will be able to continue your moves until you miss. <br />
* When the enemy ship becomes dead - all the cells around it get covered in dots.

<br/> <br />
2. After finding the first piece next move is going to be random around the current piece (1 to 4 in this case) until it hits next time. <br/>

<br /> <br />
3. When it gets to the edge it checks if the edge's Y-axis coordinate is the same the original "hit" piece to determine whether the ship is horizontal.

<br /> <br />
4. Now it goes back to the original ship piece shot and moves the opposite direction (up/down or left/right depending on the condition if the ship is horizontal, which it determined last step).

 <br />
* Enemy algorithm works the same with any ship size and it also understands if the cell was already shot and attacks the opposite way. <br />
* This algorithm is the most effective way to play "Sea Battle" and usually people use the same strategy. <br /> <br />
